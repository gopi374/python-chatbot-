ðŸŽ¤ Speech Recognition Chatbot in Python A lightweight voice-enabled chatbot that converts speech to text, processes input, and replies via text-to-speech.

A speech recognition chatbot in Python is a program that converts spoken language to text, processes the input to generate a response, and replies via text-to-speech. It typically combines speech-to-text (STT) , natural language processing (NLP) , and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies. Here's a concise overview:

Key Components:
Speech Recognition :
Uses libraries like SpeechRecognition to capture audio from a microphone and convert it to text. Google Web Speech API (via Recognizer) is commonly used for STT.
Intent Processing :
Employs rule-based logic, keyword matching, or lightweight NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, or transformers) to understand user intent and generate responses.
Text-to-Speech :
Leverages tools like pyttsx3 (offline) or gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to vocalize the chatbot's replies.
Workflow:
Listen to user input via microphone.
Convert speech to text.
Process text to determine intent/response.
Generate a reply and convert it to audio.
Play the audio response.
